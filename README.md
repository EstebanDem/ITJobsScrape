# ITJobsScrape
## Problem

I wanted to get all the job offers from the IT JOBS site so that later I could analyze them

![IT Jobs List](https://github.com/EstebanDem/ITJobsScrape/blob/main/itscrp.gif)




## Solution

Using mainly 'BeautifulSoup' I do a quick scan of all the offers, and then input one by one to get the complete description of each one and save it in a .csv file for future use.
